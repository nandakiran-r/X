## Project Details

### Overview
HerSakhi is an AI-powered Ayurvedic health tracker designed to support women's wellness. It enables menstrual and PCOS tracking, pregnancy and newborn care support, and provides affordable, natural healthcare solutions through AI-driven insights and Ayurvedic remedies.

### Problem Statement
Women often struggle with managing menstrual health, PCOS, pregnancy, and newborn care due to the lack of accessible, affordable, and natural healthcare options. Conventional healthcare solutions may be expensive, difficult to access, or not aligned with holistic wellness practices.

### Solution
HerSakhi addresses this issue by integrating AI-powered cycle analysis, Ayurvedic home remedies, pregnancy and postpartum care guidance, and a chatbot for instant health advice. By combining technology with traditional healthcare wisdom, the platform ensures personalized, sustainable, and natural self-care solutions for women.
